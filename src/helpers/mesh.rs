//!
//! This module contains implementations and traits that enable MPC helpers to communicate with
//! each other. In order for helpers to send messages, they need to know the destination. In some
//! cases this might be the exact address of helper host/instance (for example IP address), but
//! in many situations MPC helpers simply need to be able to send messages to the
//! corresponding helper without needing to know the exact location - this is what this module
//! enables MPC helper service to do.
